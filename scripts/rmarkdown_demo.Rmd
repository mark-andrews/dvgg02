# Introduction

We are investigating whether the effect is real.

# Results

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is the diamonds data.", fig.align="center", fig.height=6}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
diamonds2 <- sample_frac(diamonds, 0.01)
p15 <- ggplot(diamonds2,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price,
                     colour = cut)
) + geom_point() + theme_classic() +scale_colour_brewer(palette = 'Set1')

weight_df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mark-andrews/dvgg02/master/data/weight.csv")

p16 <- ggplot(weight_df,
              aes(x = gender, y = height)
) + geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Female" = 'Women',
                              "Male" = "Men"))

plot_grid(p15, p16, labels = "auto", ncol = 1)
```



# Discussion

Our results have shown that the effect is real.
By the way, the average price of a diamond is `r mean(diamonds2$price)`.
